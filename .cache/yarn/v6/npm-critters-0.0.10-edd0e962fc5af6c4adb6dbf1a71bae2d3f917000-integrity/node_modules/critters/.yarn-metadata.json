This tradeoff allows Critters to be very **fast and lightweight**. It also means Critters inlines all CSS rules used by your document, rather than only those needed for above-the-fold content. For alternatives, see [Similar Libraries](#similar-libraries).\n\nCritters' design makes it a good fit when inlining critical CSS for prerendered/SSR'd Single Page Applications. It was developed to be an excellent compliment to [prerender-loader](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/prerender-loader), combining to dramatically improve first paint time for most Single Page Applications.\n\n## Features\n\n- Fast - no browser, few dependencies\n- Integrates with Webpack [critters-webpack-plugin]\n- Supports preloading and/or inlining critical fonts\n- Prunes unused CSS keyframes and media queries\n- Removes inlined CSS rules from lazy-loaded stylesheets\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, install Critters as a development dependency:\n\n```sh\nnpm i -D critters\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D critters\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```diff\n+    const Critters = require('critters');\n\n+    const c = new Critters({\n+      // optional configuration (see below)\n+    })\n+    const res = c.process(html)\n```\n\n## Usage with webpack\n\n```diff\n// webpack.config.js\n+const Critters = require('critters-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n+    new Critters({\n+      // optional configuration (see below)\n+    })\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! The resultant html will have its critical CSS inlined and the stylesheets lazy-loaded.\n\n## Usage\n\n<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->\n\n### Critters\n\nCreate a Critters plugin instance with the given options.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `options` **Options** Options to control how Critters inlines CSS.\n\n**Examples**\n\n```javascript\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    new Critters({\n      // Outputs: <link rel=\"preload\" onload=\"this.rel='stylesheet'\">\n      preload: 'swap',\n\n      // Don't inline critical font-face rules, but preload the font URLs:\n      preloadFonts: true,\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Critters\n\nAll optional. Pass them to `new Critters({ ... })`.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `options`\n\n**Properties**\n\n- `external` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Inline styles from external stylesheets _(default: `true`)_\n- `inlineThreshold` **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** Inline external stylesheets smaller than a given size _(default: `0`)_\n- `minimumExternalSize` **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** If the non-critical external stylesheet would be below this size, just inline it _(default: `0`)_\n- `pruneSource` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Remove inlined rules from the external stylesheet _(default: `true`)_\n- `mergeStylesheets` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Merged inlined stylesheets into a\n  single \\<style\\> tag _(default: `true`)_\n- `additionalStylesheets` **[String[]](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Glob for matching other stylesheets which should be used to evaluate critical CSS _(default: '')_\n- `preload` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Which [preload strategy](#preloadstrategy) to use\n- `noscriptFallback` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Add `<noscript>` fallback to JS-based strategies\n- `inlineFonts` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Inline critical font-face rules _(default: `false`)_\n- `preloadFonts` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Preloads critical fonts _(default: `true`)_\n- `fonts` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Shorthand for setting `inlineFonts`+`preloadFonts`- Values:\n  - `true` to inline critical font-face rules and preload the fonts\n  - `false` to don't inline any font-face rules and don't preload fonts\n- `keyframes` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Controls which keyframes rules are inlined.- Values:\n  - `\"critical\"`: _(default)_ inline keyframes rules used by the critical CSS\n  - `\"all\"` inline all keyframes rules\n  - `\"none\"` remove all keyframes rules\n- `compress` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Compress resulting critical CSS _(default: `true`)_\n- `logLevel` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Controls [log level](#loglevel) of the plugin _(default: `\"info\"`)_\n\n### LogLevel\n\nControls log level of the plugin. Specifies the level the logger should use. A logger will\nnot produce output for any log level beneath the specified level. Available levels and order\nare:\n\n- **\"info\"** _(default)_\n- **\"warn\"**\n- **\"error\"**\n- **\"trace\"**\n- **\"debug\"**\n- **\"silent\"**\n\nType: (`\"info\"` \\| `\"warn\"` \\| `\"error\"` \\| `\"trace\"` \\| `\"debug\"` \\| `\"silent\"`)\n\n### PreloadStrategy\n\nThe mechanism to use for lazy-loading stylesheets.\n_[JS]_ indicates that a strategy requires JavaScript (falls back to `<noscript>`).\n\n- **default:** Move stylesheet links to the end of the document and insert preload meta tags in their place.\n- **\"body\":** Move all external stylesheet links to the end of the document.\n- **\"media\":** Load stylesheets asynchronously by adding `media=\"not x\"` and removing once loaded. _[JS]_\n- **\"swap\":** Convert stylesheet links to preloads that swap to `rel=\"stylesheet\"` once loaded. _[JS]_\n- **\"js\":** Inject an asynchronous CSS loader similar to [LoadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) and use it to load stylesheets. _[JS]_\n- **\"js-lazy\":** Like `\"js\"`, but the stylesheet is disabled until fully loaded.\n\nType: (default | `\"body\"` \\| `\"media\"` \\| `\"swap\"` \\| `\"js\"` \\| `\"js-lazy\"`)\n\n## Similar Libraries\n\nThere are a number of other libraries that can inline Critical CSS, each with a slightly different approach. Here are a few great options:\n\n- [Critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical)\n- [Penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse)\n- [webpack-critical](https://github.com/lukeed/webpack-critical)\n- [webpack-plugin-critical](https://github.com/nrwl/webpack-plugin-critical)\n- [html-critical-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/anthonygore/html-critical-webpack-plugin)\n- [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap)\n\n## License\n\n[Apache 2.0](LICENSE)\n\nThis is not an official Google product.\n\n[critical css]: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/\n[html-webpack-plugin]: https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin\n",
