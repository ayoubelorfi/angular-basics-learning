If it isn't\nsupported, an error is thrown.\n\n`force` argument will override the node version check, but not the npm\nversion check, as this typically would indicate that the current version of\nnpm is unable to install the package properly for some reason.\n\nError code: 'EBADENGINE'\n\n### .checkPlatform(pkg, force)\n\nCheck if OS/Arch is supported by the package.\n\nError code: 'EBADPLATFORM'\n",
