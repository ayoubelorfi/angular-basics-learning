Note that if it's anything other than\n  // 'pipe' then the stdout/stderr values on the result will be missing.\n  // npm cli sets this to 'inherit' for explicit run-scripts (test, etc.)\n  // but leaves it as 'pipe' for install scripts that run in parallel.\n  stdio: 'inherit',\n\n  // print the package id and script, and the command to be run, like:\n  // > somepackage@1.2.3 postinstall\n  // > make all-the-things\n  // Defaults true when stdio:'inherit', otherwise suppressed\n  banner: true,\n})\n  .then(({ code, signal, stdout, stderr, pkgid, path, event, script }) => {\n    // do something with the results\n  })\n  .catch(er => {\n    // command did not work.\n    // er is decorated with:\n    // - code\n    // - signal\n    // - stdout\n    // - stderr\n    // - path\n    // - pkgid (name@version string)\n    // - event\n    // - script\n  })\n```\n\n## API\n\nCall the exported `runScript` function with an options object.\n\nReturns a promise that resolves to the result of the execution.  Promise\nrejects if the execution fails (exits non-zero) or has any other error.\nRejected errors are decorated with the same values as the result object.\n\nIf the stdio options mean that it'll have a piped stdin, then the stdin is\nended immediately on the child process.  If stdin is shared with the parent\nterminal, then it is up to the user to end it, of course.\n\n### Results\n\n- `code` Process exit code\n- `signal` Process exit signal\n- `stdout` stdout data (Buffer, or String when `stdioString` set to true)\n- `stderr` stderr data (Buffer, or String when `stdioString` set to true)\n- `path` Path to the package executing its script\n- `event` Lifecycle event being run\n- `script` Command being run\n\n### Options\n\n- `path` Required.  The path to the package having its script run.\n- `event` Required.  The event being executed.\n- `args` Optional, default `[]`.  Extra arguments to pass to the script.\n- `env` Optional, object of fields to add to the environment of the\n  subprocess.  Note that process.env IS inherited by default These are\n  always set:\n  - `npm_package_json` The package.json file in the folder\n  - `npm_lifecycle_event` The event that this is being run for\n  - `npm_lifecycle_script` The script being run\n  - The `package.json` fields described in\n    [RFC183](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/183/files).\n- `scriptShell` Optional, defaults to `/bin/sh` on Unix, defaults to\n  `env.ComSpec` or `cmd` on Windows.  Custom script to use to execute the\n  command.\n- `stdio` Optional, defaults to `'pipe'`.  The same as the `stdio` argument\n  passed to `child_process` functions in Node.js.  Note that if a stdio\n  output is set to anything other than `pipe`, it will not be present in\n  the result/error object.\n- `cmd` Optional.  Override the script from the `package.json` with\n  something else, which will be run in an otherwise matching environment.\n- `stdioString` Optional, defaults to `false`.  Return string values for\n  `stderr` and `stdout` rather than Buffers.\n- `banner` Optional, defaults to `true`.  If the `stdio` option is set to\n  `'inherit'`, then print a banner with the package name and version, event\n  name, and script command to be run.  Set explicitly to `false` to disable\n  for inherited stdio.\n\nNote that this does _not_ run pre-event and post-event scripts.  The\ncaller has to manage that process themselves.\n\n## Differences from [npm-lifecycle](https://github.com/npm/npm-lifecycle)\n\nThis is an implementation to satisfy [RFC\n90](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/90), [RFC\n77](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/77), and [RFC\n73](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/73).\n\nApart from those behavior changes in npm v7, this is also just refresh of\nthe codebase, with modern coding techniques and better test coverage.\n\nFunctionally, this means:\n\n- Output is not dumped to the top level process's stdio by default.\n- Less stuff is put into the environment.\n- It is not opinionated about logging.  (So, at least with the logging\n  framework in npm v7.0 and before, the caller has to call\n  `log.disableProgress()` and `log.enableProgress()` at the appropriate\n  times, if necessary.)\n- The directory containing the `node` executable is _never_ added to the\n  `PATH` environment variable.  (Ie, `--scripts-prepend-node-path` is\n  effectively always set to `false`.)  Doing so causes more unintended side\n  effects than it ever prevented.\n- Hook scripts are not run by this module.  If the caller wishes to run\n  hook scripts, then they can override the default package script with an\n  explicit `cmd` option pointing to the `node_modules/.hook/${event}`\n  script.\n",
